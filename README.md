# Implementation Guide

## Considerations for Implementing on Your Own System or Cloud Platform

1. **Updated Code**: The `raw-text-file` provided contains updated code that should be implemented. You can directly copy and paste the commands in the specified order to execute them.

2. **Virtual Python Environment**: The repository uses a virtual Python environment named `venvhb`. I used it as a habbit to used my name abbreviation. Replace any instances of `venvhb` with the name of your virtual environment when implementing on your system.

3. **Directory and File Management**: Ensure that you use the appropriate directories and file locations. It is essential to update these paths, particularly in configuration files, to align with your environment.
