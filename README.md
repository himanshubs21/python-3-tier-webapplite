Things to consider if you're imprementing this on your own system:
-Raw-text-file contains updated codes to be implemented. You can direcctly copy paste commands in given order to get it done
-I've used "venvhb" as virtual python environment in this repository. You can replace whereever it is used with your own.
-Use the directories and locations wisely and make sure to update them specially in Conf files with sincerety.
